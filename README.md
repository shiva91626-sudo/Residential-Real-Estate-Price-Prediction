# Residential Real Estate Price Prediction

**Investment Analytics Project | SQL • Python • Tableau • Power BI**

---

## Business Problem
Property prices vary widely across locations, sizes, and conditions.  
Investors need a reliable way to identify fair prices, assess risk, and uncover hidden renovation opportunities.

---

## Project Workflow

**1. SQL – Preliminary Data Review**  
Historical housing data was loaded into SQL to validate accuracy, completeness, and realistic price ranges before analysis.

**2. Python – EDA & Price Modeling**  
Python was used to analyze key price drivers, study error patterns, and build predictive models for house prices.

**3. Tableau – Model Validation**  
Tableau dashboards were used to visually compare predicted vs actual prices and validate model behavior across property segments.
